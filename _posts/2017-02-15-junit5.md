Junit5 is slated for a GA release in Q1 2017.
If you are like me then you love testing, and would be curious as to what Junit5 brings to the table, whether or not it would be worth starting to use it, and if you have tests already, migrating those to it.
 

Basic intro

Moving from junit4 to junit5
(or from testng?)

Rules

assertions
what are my favourite assertions from testng?
collections
writing style

parameterised tests / data providers

IDE support???
